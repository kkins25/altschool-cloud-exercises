# Configuring system to meet CIS Benchmarks

## 1 Disabling cramfs filesystems

## 2  Disabling Freevxfs filesystems

## 3 Disabling jffs2 filesystem

## 4 Disabling hfs filesystem

## 5 hfsplus filesystem

## 6 squashfs filesystem

## 7 Ensuring FAT filesystem is limited


## 8 Ensuring AIDE is installed
AIDE takes a snapshot of filesystem state including modification times, permissions, and file hashes which can then be used to compare against the current state of the filesystem to detect modifications to the system

## 9 Ensuring filesystem integrity is regularly checked
Periodic file checking allows the system administrator to determine on a regular basis if critical files have been changed in an unauthorized fashion.
